//algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character and to determine//
//keep in mind //
//Each character will be treated separately.
//The last character is the point.
//Use three variables as counters.

the sentence : My name is Aymen.
The problem: The length of the sentence (the number of characters). / The number of words in the sentence / The number of vowels in the sentence.
The constraints: the sentence must contain only characters, the sentence ends with a point, the words are separated by a single space.
The input: the sentence to be put.
The output: the length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The solution: The solution consists of getting the exact number of the sentence length.

Now after gathering these pieces of information, we can start designing the algorithm.
Start //declare the beginning of algorithm (defining the sentence)
Declare 3 integer variables numCharacter, numWords and numVowels
Read the value of each variable // respectively put them into the variable as inputs
Declare an integer variable sum of numCharacter && numWords && numVowels // these variables will contain the resultant sum of the three variables.
Print the value of the variable sum of (numCharacter && numWords && numVowels)
END // here we declare the end of our algorithm
